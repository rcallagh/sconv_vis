# Spherical Convolution Visualisation 

Simple repo to generate a visualisation of how spherical convolution works in MATLAB. Main script is sconv_vis.mlx and it relies on the [csd_master repo](https://github.com/jdtournier/csd) from J. Donald Tournier for the spherical harmonics, a slightly modified version of which is present in `libs/csd-master`.
